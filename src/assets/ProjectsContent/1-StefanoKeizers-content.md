### About Stefano

What Stefano does is hard to catch in words. A lot of people either love or hate him for his TV appearances and comedy shows. When he asked me to help him create a website I jumped at the opportunity to try and make an online representation of his unique spirit.

### Problem

Stefano has a unique spirit. His shows aren’t like any comedy show I’ve seen. There are a lot of absurdistic aspects that throw the audience off. The main focus points in this website are to clearly show the dates his shows are played, show what is being said about him in the media, show a way to contact him, and do this in an original style.

### Solution

After talking with Stefano about what he wanted out of his website, I came up with some ideas and sketched them out. A few iterations later we came to a design that used his expressive photo’s as the base for his site. By visually showing bodyparts on top of eachother, starting with his upperbody and going lower with each element, it creates a strange, almost naked representation of him. This fit well with his show that he wanted to promote.

### My role

In this project I was the project manager and overall designer. Together with another developer we brought my ideas to life.
