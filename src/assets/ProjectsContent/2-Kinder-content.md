Kinder wants people to do good, better. First they research charities and help them improve based on their results. If they do well enough, Kinder publishes them on their site and makes it easy for people to donate them. This way, people who lost trust in the charitable sector can donate confidently to transparent and effective organisations.

I joined Kinder right at the start in 2017 as an interaction designer. As with most startups, I helped out with a lot of different tasks. One day I would design a complex user onboarding flow, and the other I would at the reception of an event, scanning tickets and being a representative of the company. Being a flat organization, I really liked the ability for every member of the company to bring new ideas to the table and seeing them come to life.

My main job at Kinder was to make sure all users would have a great experience when using their products. This was an interesting challenge because of all the different users. Charity employees, online magazine editors and people who want to support charities all have different wants and needs that need to be addressed when helping them with Kinderâ€™s services. To make sure this happened, I did user research, user flows, wireframes, user tests, user interface designs, animations and worked closely with the developers on making sure everything was implemented as planned. Being a small company, I also helped the editorial team with social media posts and other visual needs.
