What Stefano does is hard to catch in words. A lot of people either love or hate him for his TV appearances and comedy shows. When he asked me to help him create a website I jumped at the opportunity to try and make an online representation of his unique spirit.

After talking with Stefano about what he wanted out of his website, I came up with some ideas and sketched them out. A few iterations later we came to a design that used his expressive photoâ€™s as the base for his site. By visually showing bodyparts on top of eachother, starting with his upperbody and going lower with each element, it creates a strange, almost naked representation of him. This fit well with his show that he wanted to promote.

In this project I was the project manager and overall designer. Together with another developer we brought my ideas to life.
