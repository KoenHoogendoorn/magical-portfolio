While running a Dungeons and Dragons game (read more about what that means [here](http://www.koenhoogendoorn.nl/dragon's-quill), I keep track of a lot of things at the same time. Whoâ€™s turn is it? What is everybody doing? Is everybody still having fun? What would a demonic overlord say to an angry dwarf dressed up as a butler?

Especially during a battle, there are a lot of statistics and numbers to keep track of. To relieve some of the thinkwork, I designed a small tool for my phone to keep next to my notepad. It allows you to write down the names of monsters fighting the heroes and assign a color and a number of hitpoints to them. After that, you can incrementally change it.

I designed the app and a colleague who I play D&D with developed it.

The live version of this tool can be found [here](https://aartvanempel.github.io/hitpoint-calculator/).
