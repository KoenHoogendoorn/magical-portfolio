![Mockup of the Financial offices website](ProjectsImages/FinancialOffices/FinancialOffices-mockup.png)

While talking about what this site should propagate, my client and I worked out these requirements: generate trust, make people call and focus on our strengths.

Although Financial Offices isnâ€™t the biggest business on the block, it is the highest. Their spaces are located in the highest floor of the highest building in the top financial district of the Netherlands. In the designs and copy, I made sure that the website is focussing on this fact by showing the height of the building and the amazing view from the top floor.

To generate trust, I advised on showing the impressive companies that are already part of the Financial Offices community. Showing their info can really help make a potential customer feel like they would be part of a professional network when joining.

The client told me how most customers like to call instead of using an online tool to get in contact. Financial offices is also a smaller business centre compared to their competitors. To make calling their main way of contact, it also makes them more personal. Differentiating them from their competitors.

I designed the website and worked together with a freelance developer to make the site a reality.
