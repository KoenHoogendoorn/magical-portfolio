After a sunny day drinking coffee, me and a friend of mine started to talk about the news. As you might have noticed, 2020 wasn’t the happiest year and articles in the news reflected this. He said he used to black out words of news articles and create a poem with the words left over. I loved the idea and that day we started working on ‘Streepgedicht’.

This tool gets news article titles from popular dutch news platform nu.nl. It groups them together in different categories and by clicking on words, you are able to ‘cross them out’ and save them. It’s designed mainly for mobile use since we wanted to use the tool whenever we were bored. We made a bunch of them that we thought were funny and texted them to each other. Eventually we also made an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/streepgedicht/) where we posted them.

I designed the tool and a friend of mine developed it.

The live version of this tool can be found [here](https://streepgedicht.nl/).
