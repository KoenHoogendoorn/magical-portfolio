### Problem

“I just need a simple website. But I also want something cool.” This is how our conversation started when we talked about Titia’s website. Growing up together, we often spent afternoons looking at silly things online. One of those things was soundboards. Ah, the good old days, where pressing a button and a sound came out was enough to entertain ourselves for hours.

### Solution

Since Titia has made several iconic videos online, we had the idea to use sounds from those videos for her very own soundboard. Using her illustrations as buttons was only natural to make it really fit Titia’s style. The other content is displayed quite simply without a lot of fuzz. This combination works really well. During the years it has been live, we have done google analytics reviews on what people are most interested in on her site, and updated the site accordingly. Getting rid of content that people aren’t interested in, and focusing on parts that they are visiting often.

### My role

I designed and developed this website.
