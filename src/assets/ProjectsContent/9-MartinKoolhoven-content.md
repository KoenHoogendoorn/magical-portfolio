### Problem

Martin wanted a simple site that fitted his ‘style’. He often shows himself in the media dressed in a nice black suit, black shirt and black glasses on a white or black background. The content of the site was picked up from his previous site. This was already working really well, so the main objective was a style overhaul.

### Solution

Because of his fashion style, the first version of this site was a clean black and white version. While working on that version, I came across the image of him in the background with Kit Harington dressed as a cowboy in the front. Remembering how Martin likes westerns, it made me think of old western movie posters. I did a bit of research on western posters and tried to have aspects of them come back in a second ‘wild card’ version. It included a bold western typeface over some illustrative flair, uses a primary color and has a cool cowboy in the front.

Showing the two versions, he really liked the western version. So I continued designing it until everyone was happy and a colleague developed it.

### My role

I designed the website and a colleague of mine developed it.
