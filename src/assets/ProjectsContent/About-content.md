Hi, I’m Koen and I love designing and developing digital products. Currently I’m based in Utrecht and I’ve been creating digital products for 7 years. Professional contacts describe me as a team player, hard worker and generally positive person.

During my studies towards a bachelor's in Communication and Multimedia Design at the Hogeschool of Amsterdam, I started an internship at
[Tag the Love](https://www.tagthelove.com/). After the internship finished, I continued working here alongside my educational programme. After graduating, I started working here fulltime. Here I worked on personal websites for people with different styles. I learned a lot from working on a bunch of different projects.

Next, I started [working at Kinder](http://koenhoogendoorn.nl/kinder). Helping charities do better, it was great to work at a company that wants to make the world a better place. It was a nice change of pace to experience working on a single project for a longer time. Although it encompassed multiple products, the overall mission and brand was the same.

In my time off, I like playing guitar, running, reading and gamenights with friends. Being a bit of a fantasy nerd, I love playing and talking about [Dungeons and Dragons](http://koenhoogendoorn.nl/dragons-quill). So, to make this website a bit more personal and fun, I chose to make it ~~fantasy themed~~ **MAGICAL**.
